Metadata for the data published in "Guzman, L.M., Kelly, T. and Elle, E. (202X)Â A dataset for pollinator diversity and their interactions with plants in the Pacific NorthWest. Submitted to Ecology".

This database compiles data collected for 17 separate research projects conducted between 2005 and 2017, and contains information on 67,968 pollinators collected from 2005 to 2017. These pollinators were collected through netting, in which case the plant visited was also recorded, and pan-trapping. The pollinators were collected in 182 unique locations, where the majority (144 locations) were visited in a single year and some locations were visited in 5 years (4 locations). The dataset contains 937 pollinators and 473 plant species. This dataset provides information on pollinators from a broad range of habitats, including blueberry fields, Oak Savannah ecosystems, Scrubb-steppe, hedgerow and restored habitats, and urban parks. 

The data is a csv file with 23 variables: 

catalog_number, pollinator_family, pollinator_genus, pollinator_species, pollinator_sex, plant_sp_code, plant_species, collection_method, pantrap_colour, collector_number, day_collected, month_collected, year_collected, time_of_day_collected, location_description, location_name, habitat, latitude, longitude, basis_of_record, location_specimen, study_director, study

"pollinator_sex" is the sex of the pollinator (if possible to identify) (Character)

"plant_sp_code" is the code for plant species (Character)

"plant_species" is the plant species name at genus level, if possible species level (Character)

"collection_method" is the collection method in the field (Character)

"pantrap_colour" is the colour of the pantrap (if a pantrap was used) (Character)

"collector_number" is the number identifying the collector (Numeric)

"day_collected" is the day sample was collected (Numeric)
