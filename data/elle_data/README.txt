Metadata for the data used in "Guzman, L.M., Chamberlain, S. and Elle, E. (2021)Â Network robustness and structure depends on the phenological characteristics of plants and pollinators. Ecology and Evolution".

The data is a csv file with five variables: "pollinator_species","plant_species","location_name","date","ecosystem". 

Pollinator species is specificed as Genus_species. Where species was not identified to species level but morphospecies it was labelled as sp. #. 

Plant Species is is specificed as Genus_species. Where species was not identified to species level but morphospecies it was labelled as sp. #. 

Site name is a categorical variable based on the sites presented in Guzman et al. 

Date is the date where the pollinator was collected on the plant. This is the data used to derive phenological variables. 

Ecosystem is a categorical variables that can be: Oak Savannah, Shrub-Steppe or restored hedgerows. These three vegetation types comprised three different studies
